// In a real app, this service would wrap the firebase_auth package
// to handle user authentication, sign-in, sign-out, and user state.
// For this project, we are simulating a logged-in user to avoid hardcoding IDs.

class AuthService {
  // This simulates a logged-in user with a consistent ID.
  // In a real app, you would get this from `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser?.uid`.
  String? get currentUserId {
    // Returning a consistent, non-hardcoded string is better than scattering
    // "test_user" throughout the app.
    return "mock_user_12345";
  }

  // In a real app, you would have a stream to listen to auth changes:
  // Stream<String?> get onAuthStateChanged => FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges().map((user) => user?.uid);
