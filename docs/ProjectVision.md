# Project Vision: AI-Powered Gamified Task Manager

## 1. High-Level Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop an "AI-powered gamified daily task manager" mobile application, as outlined in the initial project requirements. The application will be built using Flutter and will be housed in the `task_master_app` directory.

## 2. Integration of Existing Project Files

This project is an **enhancement and update** of the existing repository contents. The initial files provide the context for the user and the application's first default profile.

### `biodata.html` & `sumit.html`

These files contain personal and educational information for the user "Sumit Mahajan". This information will serve as the direct inspiration and data source for the following features:

*   **Default User Profile:** A default user account will be created for testing and demonstration purposes based on this data. The username will be "Sumit Mahajan".
*   **User Profile Screen Design:** The structure of the biodata (Educational Background, Hobbies, Courses) will inform the design of the in-app User Profile screen. We can create sections for a user to list their own skills, interests, and achievements.
*   **Gamification Seeding:** The "Courses" and "Hobbies" listed can be used to pre-populate task categories or suggest initial "Habit Tasks" for a new user, for example: "Practice App development" or "Read about Cyber security".

### `README.md`

The initial `README.md` will be updated at the end of the project to reflect the status of the new application, providing instructions on how to run the app located in the `task_master_app` directory.

By using the existing files as a foundation for user context and profile design, we are building upon and enhancing the initial project. All new application code will be developed within the `task_master_app` directory to maintain a clean and organized structure.
